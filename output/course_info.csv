The course necessarily focuses on Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army’s efforts to achieve independence from Britain, but considerable attention is also given to Ulster Unionist resistance to separatism. Additionally, other forces and dynamics that shaped this seminal period are explored, such as sectarian violence in Northern Ireland; conflict between rival nationalist factions in the south; labour and socialist agitations; agrarian discontents; and the women’s suffrage and feminist movements."
022636,IRST,333,The Irish Language and its Culture II,UGRD,"Prerequisite: IRST 233; MIRI 290; or permission of the School. Under pressure for over 200 years from the expanding use of English, Irish is still considered by many a crucial underpinning of Irish national identity. This course assumes elementary knowledge of the Irish language as a platform for students to access cultural forms (memoirs, poetry, short stories, sean-nós songs, films) and media such as radio, newspapers, television, and podcasts. In particular, the course examines how language is intimately tied to place and landscape (dinnsheanchas: the Irish lore of place names) and how it both actively and subliminally remains a potent force in Irish cultural life."
022637,IRST,344,CLASSICS OF IRISH THEATRE,UGRD,"This course traces a colourful history from the mid-19th century to the present, exploring, amongst other works, the melodramas of Dionysius Boucicault; the pithy plays of Oscar Wilde; the arguably propagandistic work of WB Yeats and Augusta Gregory; the existentialism of Samuel Beckett; the Hiberno-Greek tragedies of Marina Carr; and the Tarantino inspired comedies of Martin McDonagh. Illuminating the politics — national, postcolonial, gendered and global — present in Irish theatre, this course shows that when theatre holds a mirror up to the Irish nation, a wider world is reflected back."
022638,IRST,371,IRISH CULTURAL TRADS/QUEBEC,UGRD,"Music, song, and dance have consistently acted as conduits for the integration of the Irish immigrants into Québécois society. This interdisciplinary course explores the history of Irish traditional music in Quebec since the 18th century. Using archive recordings, ballads, and dance music, the course traces the history of Irish settlement in Quebec, and focuses specifically on the diaspora of Irish music makers to the province. In exploring this eclectic soundscape, particular emphasis is given to Irish music communities in rural and urban Quebec, from the Gaspé through Quebec City and Montreal, to the Gatineau and Ottawa Valleys."
022639,IRST,373,IRISH TRAD MUSIC/CANADA,UGRD,"The cultural history of Irish traditional music in Canada is inextricably linked to a matrix of Irish immigration and settlement that began in the late 1600s and that stretched from Newfoundland to the Yukon, from Hudson Bay to the Great Lakes, evidenced in music played by Irish, French, Scottish, and First Nation communities across Canada today. Exploring the music history of the Irish in the Atlantic provinces, Lower and Upper Canada, and the Western provinces, this course draws on analytical models in history, anthropology, and cultural studies, as well as ethnomusicology and music criticism."

This seminar explores the traditions of rebellion that strikingly marked the histories of Ireland and Canada. The Irish Rising of 1798 and the 1837-38 Rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada involved class struggles, religious tensions, and attempts to define the democratic futures of both nations.

047492,IRST,343,Cinema in Quebec and Ireland,UGRD,"This course offers a comparative study of Quebec and Ireland’s cinema. As cultures, Quebec and Ireland share a history of Catholicism, a relationship with British colonialism, anxiety around language, and unresolved debates about nationalism and state formation. But these points of contact are problematic. This course teases out the complexities and importance of some of these points of contact and divergence so as to engage, in a fully realized way, in a comparative analysis."

With the aim of exploring contemporary Irish identity in our globalized era, this course examines performances of Irishness — from Montreal’s St. Patrick’s Day to alternative queer beauty pageants in Dublin, from history-making Irish political speeches to modern day street protests — and addresses questions of cultural identity, cultural authenticity and cultural evolution."
048405,IRST,347,CONTEMPORARY IRISH THEATRE,UGRD,"This course offers a panorama of Ireland’s vibrant contemporary theatre landscape. It puts the exciting experimental developments of recent years under the spotlight, engaging with Irish drama that blurs the line between reality and fiction, that immerses its audiences in morally challenging worlds, and that pushes the boundaries of theatre as a medium. From the collectively devised works of Charabanc to Verbatim plays about the Northern Irish troubles, from activist theatre to street theatre, this course explores what happens when theatremakers step outside of conventional spaces and working methods to make art for our mediatized, technologized and globalized era."
048406,IRST,354,IRISH CHILD & YOUNG ADLT LIT,UGRD,"This course examines the figure of the child and the teenager in Irish culture through an exploration of Irish children’s literature, texts written for adults such as Patrick McCabe’s The Butcher Boy, and Irish films that focus on childhood. By focusing on a variety of genres, Irish childhood is explored from a range of perspectives such as the importance of the mythological and fantastic tradition on conceptions of the child and childhood, the significance of place and landscape, the gendering of Irish childhood, and the rise of young adult literature, as well as questions of sexuality, ethnicity, globalization, nostalgia, and national identity."

049109,IRST,304,Sexualities in the Irish Diaspora,UGRD,"This course investigates the rich history that sex and sexual identities have played in shaping the Irish Diaspora over the past 200 years. Representations of Irish sexualities and gendered expectations have been a controversial constant in the story of the Irish abroad and their descendants in the global Irish Diaspora.

This seminar explores the complex and politically charged relationship between history and memory in modern Ireland in the contexts of politics, popular culture, commemoration practices, and scholarship. Drawing on the insights offered by the interdisciplinary field of memory studies, it explores the interactions between past and present and memory and forgetting by tracing the ways key historical events have been historicized, revised, commemorated, and otherwise remembered (and silenced) over time by nationalists, unionists, “exiles,” and other “communities of memory” in Ireland and among the Irish Diaspora. Possible memory case studies include the 1641 Rebellion; the Williamite War; the 1798 Rising; the Great Famine; the First World War and the events of the Irish Revolution; the Northern Irish “Troubles”; and Church-State institutional abuse in independent Ireland."

048876,MSCA,646,SEMINAR IN LEADERSHIP,GRAD,"This course adopts the interactional framework of leadership, which considers that the leadership process is a function of three components: the leader, the followers, and the context. The course is structured to cover classic and emergent theories that address each of these components; though most theories focus on one of these three components, they also inform the other components in the model, either implicitly or explicitly. Implications for the practice of leadership are addressed through class discussions. An effort is made to ensure that students do not adopt a myopic view of leadership. Rather, different perspectives on the process of leadership are presented, that make radically different assumptions. Students are therefore required to identify these assumptions and develop well-articulated arguments that either support or refute these assumptions in order to develop a sophisticated view of leadership."
048877,MSCA,648,SEMINAR IN INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT,GRAD,"This seminar is designed to introduce students to the key concepts and important areas of research related to globalization, multinational corporate strategies, and organizations and management systems in both developed and developing countries. We start with an overview of international management and multinational enterprise theories followed by a discussion on important methodological issues for doing research in an international context. The impacts of national culture and national institutions of different countries on today’s global business environment are discussed as well. Specific areas such as internationalization of small and medium-sized enterprises, entry modes, international joint ventures, and management practices are covered. The seminar concludes by discussing future research trends in this field. A key goal is to articulate appropriate research questions, develop theoretical frameworks, design empirical strategies, and to write an academic paper using key components from this seminar."
048878,MSCA,649,SEMINAR IN COMPARATIVE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE,GRAD,"Corporate governance, defined broadly, is the study of power and influence over decision making within the corporation. Comparative corporate governance examines how institutions in different social and economic contexts influence this relationship and its consequences for the ownership, management, and strategic competitiveness of firms. In this seminar we address questions such as: How is corporate governance practised in different countries? Why are corporate governance practices similar or different across countries? Can we identify international best practices of corporate governance? To what extent are corporate governance best practices transferable across international contexts? How do different systems of corporate governance embody different economic, social, and political trade-offs among corporate stakeholders? We approach the questions from managerial, economic, legal, political, sociological and cultural perspectives. Using both conceptual and empirical studies, we also focus on a range of substantial issues, including corporate governance in family firms and in emerging market business groups."
048879,MSCA,651,SEMINAR IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACROSS CONTEXTS,GRAD,"This course provides an overview of the diverse manifestations of contemporary entrepreneurship research. We review and critically evaluate the study of entrepreneurship across the contexts of new venture creation, family, social, sustainable, corporate, bottom of the pyramid and others. We cross levels of analysis—from individual to family, to firm, to network, to industry—and theoretical traditions. There is a strong emphasis on critical reasoning, empirical scrutiny and theoretical development. Students develop competencies in all aspects of the entrepreneurship research process, culminating with their own independent contributions to the field through a novel research paper."
048880,MSCA,641,SEMINAR IN STAFFING AND CAREER MANAGEMENT,GRAD,"This seminar provides an overview of theory, research, and applications in the fields of staffing and career management. We discuss the processes of getting job applicants into organizations and of retaining them and moving them through the ranks once they are there. Specific topics to be explored include organizational context and staffing strategy, legal issues, internal and external recruitment processes, selection methods, promotions and employee training. Emphasis is placed on scholarly reviews of the evidence, analysis of primary research articles, and the application of science-based practice to the processes of staffing and career management."
048905,MSCA,654,SEMINAR IN CONSULTING,GRAD,"This course focuses on the management consulting profession and process. The course is structured around three parallel streams and provides important concepts and ideas for the tool-kit of the management consultant involved in analytical as well as change implementation projects. The first stream of the course examines the consulting process, i.e. the five phases of a consulting project from entry to termination. The second stream focuses on core consulting skills, i.e. the skills required to operate and succeed as a management consultant. These skills are essential for any type of consulting engagement, whether one works as an external or internal consultant, and whether the client in a private sector, public, or non-profit organization. The third stream is a real world consulting project that students conduct in teams with a client firm in order to apply the tools and skills discussed in class. The course concludes by reflecting on the role of internal consultants and management consulting as a career choice."

048403,SPAN,475,Translation Issues in Spanish American Culture,UGRD,"Prerequisite: SPAN 303 previously or concurrently; SPAN 306. The goal of this course is to critically revise the cultural, literary, and aesthetic role of translation in Latin American culture, particularly with regard to its textual production. Through reading and discussion of theoretical authors such as F. Schleiermacher, J. Ortega y Gasset, L. Venuti, H. K. Bhabha, and W. Mignolo, students analyze representative texts of Latin American culture which practically and aesthetically incorporate different problems and/or strategies of translation in the transcultural context of a globalization process of more than five centuries."
